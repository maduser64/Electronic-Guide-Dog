# Electronic-Guide-Dog
This project is the start of an electronic guide dog that will aid a blinnd person in crossing the road. The project uses Matlab annd its image processing toolbox to detect a car numberplate in an image after a video file has been broken down into individual frames. The change of size of the number plate will determine the speed and distance of the car resulting in a classification of a safe or unsafe road crossing.
